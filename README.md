# CYBER-SECURITY--PROJECT
This repository documents my exploration of malware analysis and reverse engineering techniques. It is intended as an educational resource for students, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts seeking a hands-on understanding of how modern malware is dissected, analyzed, and understood at both static and dynamic levels. 
Objectives
Analyze various types of malware (virus, worm, trojan, ransomware, spyware, etc.).

Reverse engineer malware binaries to uncover their behavior and functionality.

Document safe methodologies for malware analysis, ensuring an ethical and legal approach.

Demonstrate the use of analysis tools, scripts, and virtual lab setups.

Present practical insights and mitigation strategies derived from case study investigations.

Key Features
Step-by-step malware analysis guides: Walkthroughs for dissecting malware samples using static (disassembler, decompiler) and dynamic (sandbox, debugger) methods.

Reverse engineering techniques: Tutorials and examples leveraging tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, OllyDbg, and x64dbg.

Scripts and automation: Python or Bash scripts used to automate repetitive analysis tasks or extract indicators of compromise.

Case studies: Real-world or emulated incidents demonstrating forensic analysis and reporting.

Best practices: Guidelines for malware lab setup, safety precautions, and responsible disclosure.
